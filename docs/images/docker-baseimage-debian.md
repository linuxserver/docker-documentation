A custom base image built with [Debian Linux](https://debian.org) and [s6-overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay).

- Support for using our base images in your own projects is provided on a Reasonable Endeavours basis, please see our [Support Policy](https://www.linuxserver.io/supportpolicy) for details.
- There is no `latest` tag for any of our base images, by design. We often make breaking changes between versions, and we don't publish release notes like we do for the downstream images.
- If you're intending to distribute an image using one of our bases, please read our [docs on container branding](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/container-branding/) first.
- Debian releases are supported for 5 years, after which we will stop building new base images for that version.

The following line is only in this repo for loop testing:

- { date: "01.01.50:", desc: "I am the release message for this internal repo." }
