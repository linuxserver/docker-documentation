## Supported Architectures

We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker [here](https://distribution.github.io/distribution/spec/manifest-v2-2/#manifest-list) and our announcement [here](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2019/02/21/the-lsio-pipeline-project/).

Simply pulling `lscr.io/linuxserver/mediaelch:latest` should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags.

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Available | Tag |
| :----: | :----: | ---- |
| x86-64 | ✅ | amd64-\<version tag\> |
| arm64 | ❌ | |

## Application Setup

The application can be accessed at:

* https://yourhost:3001/

### Strict reverse proxies

This image uses a self-signed certificate by default. This naturally means the scheme is `https`.
If you are using a reverse proxy which validates certificates, you need to [disable this check for the container](https://docs.linuxserver.io/faq#strict-proxy).

**Modern GUI desktop apps may have compatibility issues with the latest Docker syscall restrictions. You can use Docker with the `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` setting to allow these syscalls on hosts with older Kernels or libseccomp versions.**

### Security

!!! warning

    This container provides privileged access to the host system. Do not expose it to the Internet unless you have secured it properly.

**HTTPS is required for full functionality.** Modern browser features such as WebCodecs, used for video and audio, will not function over an insecure HTTP connection.

By default, this container has no authentication. The optional `CUSTOM_USER` and `PASSWORD` environment variables enable basic HTTP auth, which is suitable only for securing the container on a trusted local network. For internet exposure, we strongly recommend placing the container behind a reverse proxy, such as [SWAG](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-swag), with a robust authentication mechanism.

The web interface includes a terminal with passwordless `sudo` access. Any user with access to the GUI can gain root control within the container, install arbitrary software, and probe your local network.

While not generally recommended, certain legacy environments specifically those with older hardware or outdated Linux distributions may require the deactivation of the standard seccomp profile to get containerized desktop software to run. This can be achieved by utilizing the `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` parameter. It is critical to use this option only when absolutely necessary as it disables a key security layer of Docker, elevating the potential for container escape vulnerabilities.

### Hardware Acceleration & The Move to Wayland

We are currently transitioning our desktop containers from X11 to Wayland. While X11 is still the default, we strongly encourage users to test the new Wayland mode.

**Important:** GPU acceleration support for X11 is being deprecated. Future development for hardware acceleration will focus entirely on the Wayland stack.

To enable Wayland mode, set the following environment variable:
*   `-e PIXELFLUX_WAYLAND=true`

**Why use Wayland?**
*   **Zero Copy Encoding:** When configured correctly with a GPU, the frame is rendered and encoded on the video card without ever being copied to the system RAM. This drastically lowers CPU usage and latency.
*   **Modern Stack:** Single-application containers utilize **Labwc** (replacing Openbox) and full desktop containers use **KDE Plasma Wayland**, providing a more modern and secure compositing environment while retaining the same user experience.

#### GPU Configuration

To use hardware acceleration in Wayland mode, we distinguish between the card used for **Rendering** (3D apps/Desktops) and **Encoding** (Video Stream).

**Configuration Variables:**
*   `DRINODE`: The path to the GPU used for **Rendering** (EGL).
*   `DRI_NODE`: The path to the GPU used for **Encoding** (VAAPI/NVENC).

If both variables point to the same device, the container will automatically enable **Zero Copy** encoding, significantly reducing CPU usage and latency.

##### Intel & AMD (Open Source Drivers)

For Intel and AMD GPUs.

```yaml
    devices:
      - /dev/dri:/dev/dri
    environment:
      - PIXELFLUX_WAYLAND=true
      # Optional: Specify device if multiple exist (IE: /dev/dri/renderD129)
      - DRINODE=/dev/dri/renderD128
      - DRI_NODE=/dev/dri/renderD128
```

##### Nvidia (Proprietary Drivers)

**Note: Nvidia support is not available for Alpine-based images.**

**Prerequisites:**
1.  **Driver:** Proprietary drivers **580 or higher** are required.
2.  **Kernel Parameter:** Set `nvidia-drm.modeset=1` in your host bootloader (GRUB/systemd-boot).
3.  **Initialization:** On headless systems, run `nvidia-modprobe --modeset` on the host (once per boot) to initialize the card.
4.  **Docker Runtime:** Configure the host docker daemon to use the Nvidia runtime:
    ```bash
    sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker
    sudo systemctl restart docker
    ```

**Compose Configuration:**

```yaml
services:
  mediaelch:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/mediaelch:latest
    environment:
      - PIXELFLUX_WAYLAND=true
      # Ensure these point to the rendered node injected by the runtime (usually renderD128)
      - DRINODE=/dev/dri/renderD128
      - DRI_NODE=/dev/dri/renderD128
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [compute,video,graphics,utility]
```

### SealSkin Compatibility

This container is compatible with [SealSkin](https://sealskin.app).

SealSkin is a self-hosted, client-server platform that provides secure authentication and collaboration features while using a browser extension to intercept user actions such as clicking a link or downloading a file and redirect them to a secure, isolated application environment running on a remote server.

*   **SealSkin Server:** [Get it Here](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-sealskin)
*   **Browser Extension:** [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sealskin-isolation/lclgfmnljgacfdpmmmjmfpdelndbbfhk) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sealskin-isolation/).
*   **Mobile App:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sealskin/id6758210210) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.linuxserver.sealskin)


### Options in all Selkies-based GUI containers

???+ note "Click to expand: Optional Run Configurations (DinD & GPU Mounts)"

    | Argument | Description |
    | :----: | --- |
    | `--privileged` | Starts a Docker-in-Docker (DinD) environment. For better performance, mount the Docker data directory from the host, e.g., `-v /path/to/docker-data:/var/lib/docker`. |
    | `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` | Mounts the host's Docker socket to manage host containers from within this container. |
    | `--device /dev/dri:/dev/dri` | Mount a GPU into the container, this can be used in conjunction with the `DRINODE` environment variable to leverage a host video card for GPU accelerated applications. |
    

???+ note "Click to expand: Legacy X11 Resolution & Acceleration"

    **Note:** This section applies only if you are **NOT** using `PIXELFLUX_WAYLAND=true`.
    
    When using 3d acceleration via Nvidia DRM or DRI3 in X11 mode, it is important to clamp the virtual display to a reasonable max resolution to avoid memory exhaustion or poor performance.
    
    * `-e MAX_RESOLUTION=3840x2160`
    
    This will set the total virtual framebuffer to 4K. By default, the virtual monitor is 16K. If you have performance issues in an accelerated X11 session, try clamping the resolution to 1080p and work up from there:
    
    ```
    -e SELKIES_MANUAL_WIDTH=1920
    -e SELKIES_MANUAL_HEIGHT=1080
    -e MAX_RESOLUTION=1920x1080
    ```
    

### Language Support - Internationalization

To launch the desktop session in a different language, set the `LC_ALL` environment variable. For example:

*   `-e LC_ALL=zh_CN.UTF-8` - Chinese
*   `-e LC_ALL=ja_JP.UTF-8` - Japanese
*   `-e LC_ALL=ko_KR.UTF-8` - Korean
*   `-e LC_ALL=ar_AE.UTF-8` - Arabic
*   `-e LC_ALL=ru_RU.UTF-8` - Russian
*   `-e LC_ALL=es_MX.UTF-8` - Spanish (Latin America)
*   `-e LC_ALL=de_DE.UTF-8` - German
*   `-e LC_ALL=fr_FR.UTF-8` - French
*   `-e LC_ALL=nl_NL.UTF-8` - Netherlands
*   `-e LC_ALL=it_IT.UTF-8` - Italian

### Application Management

There are two methods for installing applications inside the container: PRoot Apps (recommended for persistence) and Native Apps.

#### PRoot Apps (Persistent)

Natively installed packages (e.g., via `apt-get install`) will not persist if the container is recreated. To retain applications and their settings across container updates, we recommend using [proot-apps](https://github.com/linuxserver/proot-apps). These are portable applications installed to the user's persistent `$HOME` directory.

To install an application, use the command line inside the container:

```
proot-apps install filezilla
```

A list of supported applications is available [here](https://github.com/linuxserver/proot-apps?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-apps).

#### Native Apps (Non-Persistent)

You can install packages from the system's native repository using the [universal-package-install](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods/tree/universal-package-install) mod. This method will increase the container's start time and is not persistent. Add the following to your `compose.yaml`:

```yaml
  environment:
    - DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:universal-package-install
    - INSTALL_PACKAGES=libfuse2|git|gdb
```

### Advanced Configuration

???+ note "Click to expand: Hardening Options"

    These variables can be used to lock down the desktop environment for single-application use cases or to restrict user capabilities.
    
    | Variable | Description |
    | :----: | --- |
    | **`HARDEN_DESKTOP`** | Enables `DISABLE_OPEN_TOOLS`, `DISABLE_SUDO`, and `DISABLE_TERMINALS`. Also sets related Selkies UI settings (`SELKIES_FILE_TRANSFERS`, `SELKIES_COMMAND_ENABLED`, `SELKIES_UI_SIDEBAR_SHOW_FILES`, `SELKIES_UI_SIDEBAR_SHOW_APPS`) if they are not explicitly set by the user. |
    | **`HARDEN_OPENBOX`** | Enables `DISABLE_CLOSE_BUTTON`, `DISABLE_MOUSE_BUTTONS`, and `HARDEN_KEYBINDS`. It also flags `RESTART_APP` if not set by the user, ensuring the primary application is automatically restarted if closed. |
    
    **Individual Hardening Variables:**
    
    | Variable | Description |
    | :--- | --- |
    | **`DISABLE_OPEN_TOOLS`** | If true, disables `xdg-open` and `exo-open` binaries by removing their execute permissions. |
    | **`DISABLE_SUDO`** | If true, disables the `sudo` command by removing its execute permissions and invalidating the passwordless sudo configuration. |
    | **`DISABLE_TERMINALS`** | If true, disables common terminal emulators by removing their execute permissions and hiding them from the Openbox right-click menu. |
    | **`DISABLE_CLOSE_BUTTON`** | If true, removes the close button from window title bars in the Openbox window manager. |
    | **`DISABLE_MOUSE_BUTTONS`** | If true, disables the right-click and middle-click context menus and actions within the Openbox window manager. |
    | **`HARDEN_KEYBINDS`** | If true, disables default Openbox keybinds that can bypass other hardening options (e.g., `Alt+F4` to close windows, `Alt+Escape` to show the root menu). |
    | **`RESTART_APP`** | If true, enables a watchdog service that automatically restarts the main application if it is closed. The user's autostart script is made read-only and root owned to prevent tampering. |
    

???+ note "Click to expand: Selkies Application Settings"

    Using environment variables every facet of the application can be configured.
    
    **Booleans and Locking:**
    Boolean settings accept `true` or `false`. You can also prevent the user from changing a boolean setting in the UI by appending `|locked`.
    *   Example: `-e SELKIES_USE_CPU="true|locked"`
    
    **Enums and Lists:**
    These settings accept a comma-separated list of values. The first item becomes default. If only one item is provided, the UI dropdown is hidden.
    *   Example: `-e SELKIES_ENCODER="jpeg"`
    
    **Ranges:**
    Use a hyphen-separated `min-max` format for a slider, or a single number to lock the value.
    *   Example: `-e SELKIES_FRAMERATE="60"`
    
    **Manual Resolution Mode:**
    If `SELKIES_MANUAL_WIDTH` or `SELKIES_MANUAL_HEIGHT` are set, the resolution is locked to those values.

## Parameters

Containers are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

### Ports (`-p`)

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `3000:3000` | MediaElch desktop gui HTTP, must be proxied. |
| `3001:3001` | MediaElch desktop gui HTTPS. |

### Environment Variables (`-e`)

| Env | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `TZ=Etc/UTC` | specify a timezone to use, see this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List). |

### Volume Mappings (`-v`)

| Volume | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `/config` | Users home directory in the container, stores program settings and files. |

#### Miscellaneous Options

| Parameter | Function |
| :-----:   | --- |
| `--shm-size=` | Recommended for all desktop images. |

## Environment variables from files (Docker secrets)

You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend `FILE__`.

As an example:

```bash
-e FILE__MYVAR=/run/secrets/mysecretvariable
```

Will set the environment variable `MYVAR` based on the contents of the `/run/secrets/mysecretvariable` file.

## Umask for running applications

For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional `-e UMASK=022` setting.
Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) before asking for support.

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags), permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id your_user` as below:

```bash
id your_user
```

Example output:

```text
uid=1000(your_user) gid=1000(your_user) groups=1000(your_user)
```

[![Docker Universal Mods](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/yaml?color=94398d&labelColor=555555&logoColor=ffffff&style=for-the-badge&label=universal&query=%24.mods%5B%27universal%27%5D.mod_count&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Flinuxserver%2Fdocker-mods%2Fmaster%2Fmod-list.yml)](https://mods.linuxserver.io/?mod=universal "view available universal mods.")

We publish various [Docker Mods](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods) to enable additional functionality within the containers. The list of Mods available for this image (if any) as well as universal mods that can be applied to any one of our images can be accessed via the dynamic badges above.

## Support Info

* Shell access whilst the container is running:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it mediaelch /bin/bash
    ```

* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime:

    ```bash
    docker logs -f mediaelch
    ```

* Container version number:

    ```bash
    docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' mediaelch
    ```

* Image version number:

    ```bash
    docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' lscr.io/linuxserver/mediaelch:latest
    ```

## Updating Info

Most of our images are static, versioned, and require an image update and container recreation to update the app inside. With some exceptions (noted in the relevant readme.md), we do not recommend or support updating apps inside the container. Please consult the [Application Setup](#application-setup) section above to see if it is recommended for the image.

Below are the instructions for updating containers:

### Via Docker Compose

* Update images:
    * All images:

        ```bash
        docker-compose pull
        ```

    * Single image:

        ```bash
        docker-compose pull mediaelch
        ```

* Update containers:
    * All containers:

        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d
        ```

    * Single container:

        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d mediaelch
        ```

* You can also remove the old dangling images:

    ```bash
    docker image prune
    ```

### Via Docker Run

* Update the image:

    ```bash
    docker pull lscr.io/linuxserver/mediaelch:latest
    ```

* Stop the running container:

    ```bash
    docker stop mediaelch
    ```

* Delete the container:

    ```bash
    docker rm mediaelch
    ```

* Recreate a new container with the same docker run parameters as instructed above (if mapped correctly to a host folder, your `/config` folder and settings will be preserved)
* You can also remove the old dangling images:

    ```bash
    docker image prune
    ```

### Image Update Notifications - Diun (Docker Image Update Notifier)

!!! tip

    We recommend [Diun](https://crazymax.dev/diun/) for update notifications. Other tools that automatically update containers unattended are not recommended or supported.

## Building locally

If you want to make local modifications to these images for development purposes or just to customize the logic:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mediaelch.git
cd docker-mediaelch
docker build \
  --no-cache \
  --pull \
  -t lscr.io/linuxserver/mediaelch:latest .
```

The ARM variants can be built on x86_64 hardware and vice versa using `lscr.io/linuxserver/qemu-static`

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged lscr.io/linuxserver/qemu-static --reset
```

Once registered you can define the dockerfile to use with `-f Dockerfile.aarch64`.

To help with development, we generate this dependency graph.
