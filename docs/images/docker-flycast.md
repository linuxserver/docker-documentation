## Supported Architectures

We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker [here](https://distribution.github.io/distribution/spec/manifest-v2-2/#manifest-list) and our announcement [here](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2019/02/21/the-lsio-pipeline-project/).

Simply pulling `lscr.io/linuxserver/flycast:latest` should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags.

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Available | Tag |
| :----: | :----: | ---- |
| x86-64 | ✅ | amd64-\<version tag\> |
| arm64 | ✅ | arm64v8-\<version tag\> |

## Application Setup

The application can be accessed at:

* https://yourhost:3001/

### Strict reverse proxies

This image uses a self-signed certificate by default. This naturally means the scheme is `https`.
If you are using a reverse proxy which validates certificates, you need to [disable this check for the container](https://docs.linuxserver.io/faq#strict-proxy).

**Modern GUI desktop apps may have compatibility issues with the latest Docker syscall restrictions. You can use Docker with the `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` setting to allow these syscalls on hosts with older Kernels or libseccomp versions.**

### Security

!!! warning

    This container provides privileged access to the host system. Do not expose it to the Internet unless you have secured it properly.

**HTTPS is required for full functionality.** Modern browser features such as WebCodecs, used for video and audio, will not function over an insecure HTTP connection.

By default, this container has no authentication. The optional `CUSTOM_USER` and `PASSWORD` environment variables enable basic HTTP auth, which is suitable only for securing the container on a trusted local network. For internet exposure, we strongly recommend placing the container behind a reverse proxy, such as [SWAG](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-swag), with a robust authentication mechanism.

The web interface includes a terminal with passwordless `sudo` access. Any user with access to the GUI can gain root control within the container, install arbitrary software, and probe your local network.

While not generally recommended, certain legacy environments specifically those with older hardware or outdated Linux distributions may require the deactivation of the standard seccomp profile to get containerized desktop software to run. This can be achieved by utilizing the `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` parameter. It is critical to use this option only when absolutely necessary as it disables a key security layer of Docker, elevating the potential for container escape vulnerabilities.

### Options in all Selkies-based GUI containers

This container is based on [Docker Baseimage Selkies](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-baseimage-selkies), which provides the following environment variables and run configurations to customize its functionality.

#### Optional Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
| :----: | --- |
| CUSTOM_PORT | Internal port the container listens on for http if it needs to be swapped from the default `3000` |
| CUSTOM_HTTPS_PORT | Internal port the container listens on for https if it needs to be swapped from the default `3001` |
| CUSTOM_WS_PORT | Internal port the container listens on for websockets if it needs to be swapped from the default 8082 |
| CUSTOM_USER | HTTP Basic auth username, abc is default. |
| DRI_NODE | Enable VAAPI stream encoding and use the specified device IE `/dev/dri/renderD128` |
| DRINODE | Specify which GPU to use for DRI3 acceleration IE `/dev/dri/renderD129` |
| PASSWORD | HTTP Basic auth password, abc is default. If unset there will be no auth |
| SUBFOLDER | Subfolder for the application if running a subfolder reverse proxy, need both slashes IE `/subfolder/` |
| TITLE | The page title displayed on the web browser, default "Selkies" |
| DASHBOARD | Allows the user to set their dashboard. Options: `selkies-dashboard`, `selkies-dashboard-zinc`, `selkies-dashboard-wish` |
| FILE_MANAGER_PATH | Modifies the default upload/download file path, path must have proper permissions for abc user |
| START_DOCKER | If set to false a container with privilege will not automatically start the DinD Docker setup |
| DISABLE_IPV6 | If set to true or any value this will disable IPv6 |
| LC_ALL | Set the Language for the container to run as IE `fr_FR.UTF-8` `ar_AE.UTF-8` |
| NO_DECOR | If set the application will run without window borders for use as a PWA. (Decor can be enabled and disabled with Ctrl+Shift+d) |
| NO_FULL | Do not autmatically fullscreen applications when using openbox. |
| NO_GAMEPAD | Disable userspace gamepad interposer injection. |
| DISABLE_ZINK | Do not set the Zink environment variables if a video card is detected (userspace applications will use CPU rendering) |
| DISABLE_DRI3 | Do not use DRI3 acceleration if a video card is detected (userspace applications will use CPU rendering) |
| MAX_RES | Pass a larger maximum resolution for the container default is 16k `15360x8640` |
| WATERMARK_PNG | Full path inside the container to a watermark png IE `/usr/share/selkies/www/icon.png` |
| WATERMARK_LOCATION | Where to paint the image over the stream integer options below |

**`WATERMARK_LOCATION` Options:**
- **1**: Top Left
- **2**: Top Right
- **3**: Bottom Left
- **4**: Bottom Right
- **5**: Centered
- **6**: Animated

#### Optional Run Configurations

| Argument | Description |
| :----: | --- |
| `--privileged` | Starts a Docker-in-Docker (DinD) environment. For better performance, mount the Docker data directory from the host, e.g., `-v /path/to/docker-data:/var/lib/docker`. |
| `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` | Mounts the host's Docker socket to manage host containers from within this container. |
| `--device /dev/dri:/dev/dri` | Mount a GPU into the container, this can be used in conjunction with the `DRINODE` environment variable to leverage a host video card for GPU accelerated applications. Only **Open Source** drivers are supported IE (Intel,AMDGPU,Radeon,ATI,Nouveau) |

### Language Support - Internationalization

To launch the desktop session in a different language, set the `LC_ALL` environment variable. For example:

*   `-e LC_ALL=zh_CN.UTF-8` - Chinese
*   `-e LC_ALL=ja_JP.UTF-8` - Japanese
*   `-e LC_ALL=ko_KR.UTF-8` - Korean
*   `-e LC_ALL=ar_AE.UTF-8` - Arabic
*   `-e LC_ALL=ru_RU.UTF-8` - Russian
*   `-e LC_ALL=es_MX.UTF-8` - Spanish (Latin America)
*   `-e LC_ALL=de_DE.UTF-8` - German
*   `-e LC_ALL=fr_FR.UTF-8` - French
*   `-e LC_ALL=nl_NL.UTF-8` - Netherlands
*   `-e LC_ALL=it_IT.UTF-8` - Italian

### DRI3 GPU Acceleration

For accelerated apps or games, render devices can be mounted into the container and leveraged by applications using:

`--device /dev/dri:/dev/dri`

This feature only supports **Open Source** GPU drivers:

| Driver | Description |
| :----: | --- |
| Intel | i965 and i915 drivers for Intel iGPU chipsets |
| AMD | AMDGPU, Radeon, and ATI drivers for AMD dedicated or APU chipsets |
| NVIDIA | nouveau2 drivers only, closed source NVIDIA drivers lack DRI3 support |

The `DRINODE` environment variable can be used to point to a specific GPU.

DRI3 will work on aarch64 given the correct drivers are installed inside the container for your chipset.

### Nvidia GPU Support

**Note: Nvidia support is not available for Alpine-based images.**

Nvidia GPU support is available by leveraging Zink for OpenGL. When a compatible Nvidia GPU is passed through, it will also be **automatically utilized for hardware-accelerated video stream encoding** (using the `x264enc` full-frame profile), significantly reducing CPU load.

Enable Nvidia support with the following runtime flags:

| Flag | Description |
| :----: | --- |
| `--gpus all` | Passes all available host GPUs to the container. This can be filtered to specific GPUs. |
| `--runtime nvidia` | Specifies the Nvidia runtime, which provides the necessary drivers and tools from the host. |

For Docker Compose, you must first configure the Nvidia runtime as the default on the host:

```
sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker --set-as-default
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

Then, assign the GPU to the service in your `compose.yaml`:

```
services:
  flycast:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/flycast:latest
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [compute,video,graphics,utility]
```

### Application Management

There are two methods for installing applications inside the container: PRoot Apps (recommended for persistence) and Native Apps.

#### PRoot Apps (Persistent)

Natively installed packages (e.g., via `apt-get install`) will not persist if the container is recreated. To retain applications and their settings across container updates, we recommend using [proot-apps](https://github.com/linuxserver/proot-apps). These are portable applications installed to the user's persistent `$HOME` directory.

To install an application, use the command line inside the container:

```
proot-apps install filezilla
```

A list of supported applications is available [here](https://github.com/linuxserver/proot-apps?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-apps).

#### Native Apps (Non-Persistent)

You can install packages from the system's native repository using the [universal-package-install](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods/tree/universal-package-install) mod. This method will increase the container's start time and is not persistent. Add the following to your `compose.yaml`:

```yaml
  environment:
    - DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:universal-package-install
    - INSTALL_PACKAGES=libfuse2|git|gdb
```

#### Hardening

These variables can be used to lock down the desktop environment for single-application use cases or to restrict user capabilities.

##### Meta Variables

These variables act as presets, enabling multiple hardening options at once. Individual options can still be set to override the preset.

| Variable | Description |
| :----: | --- |
| **`HARDEN_DESKTOP`** | Enables `DISABLE_OPEN_TOOLS`, `DISABLE_SUDO`, and `DISABLE_TERMINALS`. Also sets related Selkies UI settings (`SELKIES_FILE_TRANSFERS`, `SELKIES_COMMAND_ENABLED`, `SELKIES_UI_SIDEBAR_SHOW_FILES`, `SELKIES_UI_SIDEBAR_SHOW_APPS`) if they are not explicitly set by the user. |
| **`HARDEN_OPENBOX`** | Enables `DISABLE_CLOSE_BUTTON`, `DISABLE_MOUSE_BUTTONS`, and `HARDEN_KEYBINDS`. It also flags `RESTART_APP` if not set by the user, ensuring the primary application is automatically restarted if closed. |

##### Individual Hardening Variables

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | --- |
| **`DISABLE_OPEN_TOOLS`** | If true, disables `xdg-open` and `exo-open` binaries by removing their execute permissions. |
| **`DISABLE_SUDO`** | If true, disables the `sudo` command by removing its execute permissions and invalidating the passwordless sudo configuration. |
| **`DISABLE_TERMINALS`** | If true, disables common terminal emulators by removing their execute permissions and hiding them from the Openbox right-click menu. |
| **`DISABLE_CLOSE_BUTTON`** | If true, removes the close button from window title bars in the Openbox window manager. |
| **`DISABLE_MOUSE_BUTTONS`** | If true, disables the right-click and middle-click context menus and actions within the Openbox window manager. |
| **`HARDEN_KEYBINDS`** | If true, disables default Openbox keybinds that can bypass other hardening options (e.g., `Alt+F4` to close windows, `Alt+Escape` to show the root menu). |
| **`RESTART_APP`** | If true, enables a watchdog service that automatically restarts the main application if it is closed. The user's autostart script is made read-only and root owned to prevent tampering. |

#### Selkies application settings

Using environment variables every facet of the application can be configured.

##### Booleans and Locking
Boolean settings accept `true` or `false`. You can also prevent the user from changing a boolean setting in the UI by appending `|locked`. The UI toggle for this setting will be hidden.

*   **Example**: To force CPU encoding on and prevent the user from disabling it:
    ```bash
    -e SELKIES_USE_CPU="true|locked"
    ```

##### Enums and Lists
These settings accept a comma-separated list of values. Their behavior depends on the number of items provided:

*   **Multiple Values**: The first item in the list becomes the default selection, and all items in the list become the available options in the UI dropdown.
*   **Single Value**: The provided value becomes the default, and the UI dropdown is hidden because the choice is locked.

*   **Example**: Force the encoder to be `jpeg` with no other options available to the user:
    ```bash
    -e SELKIES_ENCODER="jpeg"
    ```

##### Ranges
Range settings define a minimum and maximum for a value (e.g., framerate).

*   **To set a range**: Use a hyphen-separated `min-max` format. The UI will show a slider.
*   **To set a fixed value**: Provide a single number. This will lock the value and hide the UI slider.

*   **Example**: Lock the framerate to exactly 60 FPS.
    ```bash
    -e SELKIES_FRAMERATE="60"
    ```

##### Manual Resolution Mode
The server can be forced to use a single, fixed resolution for all connecting clients. This mode is automatically activated if `SELKIES_MANUAL_WIDTH`, `SELKIES_MANUAL_HEIGHT`, or `SELKIES_IS_MANUAL_RESOLUTION_MODE` is set.

*   If `SELKIES_MANUAL_WIDTH` and/or `SELKIES_MANUAL_HEIGHT` are set, the resolution is locked to those values.
*   If `SELKIES_IS_MANUAL_RESOLUTION_MODE` is set to `true` without specifying width or height, the resolution defaults to **1024x768**.
*   When this mode is active, the client UI for changing resolution is disabled.

## Usage

To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli.

!!! info

    Unless a parameter is flaged as 'optional', it is *mandatory* and a value must be provided.

### docker-compose (recommended, [click here for more info](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/docker-compose))

```yaml
---
services:
  flycast:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/flycast:latest
    container_name: flycast
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config:/config
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
      - 3001:3001
    shm_size: "1gb"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### docker cli ([click here for more info](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/))

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=flycast \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=Etc/UTC \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  -v /path/to/config:/config \
  --shm-size="1gb" \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  lscr.io/linuxserver/flycast:latest
```

## Parameters

Containers are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

### Ports (`-p`)

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `3000:3000` | HTTP Flycast desktop gui must be proxied. |
| `3001:3001` | HTTPS Flycast desktop gui. |

### Environment Variables (`-e`)

| Env | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `TZ=Etc/UTC` | specify a timezone to use, see this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List). |

### Volume Mappings (`-v`)

| Volume | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `/config` | Users home directory in the container, stores local files and settings |

#### Miscellaneous Options

| Parameter | Function |
| :-----:   | --- |
| `--shm-size=` | This is needed for Flycast to function. |

## Environment variables from files (Docker secrets)

You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend `FILE__`.

As an example:

```bash
-e FILE__MYVAR=/run/secrets/mysecretvariable
```

Will set the environment variable `MYVAR` based on the contents of the `/run/secrets/mysecretvariable` file.

## Umask for running applications

For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional `-e UMASK=022` setting.
Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) before asking for support.

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags), permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id your_user` as below:

```bash
id your_user
```

Example output:

```text
uid=1000(your_user) gid=1000(your_user) groups=1000(your_user)
```

[![Docker Universal Mods](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/yaml?color=94398d&labelColor=555555&logoColor=ffffff&style=for-the-badge&label=universal&query=%24.mods%5B%27universal%27%5D.mod_count&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Flinuxserver%2Fdocker-mods%2Fmaster%2Fmod-list.yml)](https://mods.linuxserver.io/?mod=universal "view available universal mods.")

We publish various [Docker Mods](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods) to enable additional functionality within the containers. The list of Mods available for this image (if any) as well as universal mods that can be applied to any one of our images can be accessed via the dynamic badges above.

## Support Info

* Shell access whilst the container is running:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it flycast /bin/bash
    ```

* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime:

    ```bash
    docker logs -f flycast
    ```

* Container version number:

    ```bash
    docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' flycast
    ```

* Image version number:

    ```bash
    docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' lscr.io/linuxserver/flycast:latest
    ```

## Updating Info

Most of our images are static, versioned, and require an image update and container recreation to update the app inside. With some exceptions (noted in the relevant readme.md), we do not recommend or support updating apps inside the container. Please consult the [Application Setup](#application-setup) section above to see if it is recommended for the image.

Below are the instructions for updating containers:

### Via Docker Compose

* Update images:
    * All images:

        ```bash
        docker-compose pull
        ```

    * Single image:

        ```bash
        docker-compose pull flycast
        ```

* Update containers:
    * All containers:

        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d
        ```

    * Single container:

        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d flycast
        ```

* You can also remove the old dangling images:

    ```bash
    docker image prune
    ```

### Via Docker Run

* Update the image:

    ```bash
    docker pull lscr.io/linuxserver/flycast:latest
    ```

* Stop the running container:

    ```bash
    docker stop flycast
    ```

* Delete the container:

    ```bash
    docker rm flycast
    ```

* Recreate a new container with the same docker run parameters as instructed above (if mapped correctly to a host folder, your `/config` folder and settings will be preserved)
* You can also remove the old dangling images:

    ```bash
    docker image prune
    ```

### Image Update Notifications - Diun (Docker Image Update Notifier)

!!! tip

    We recommend [Diun](https://crazymax.dev/diun/) for update notifications. Other tools that automatically update containers unattended are not recommended or supported.

## Building locally

If you want to make local modifications to these images for development purposes or just to customize the logic:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-flycast.git
cd docker-flycast
docker build \
  --no-cache \
  --pull \
  -t lscr.io/linuxserver/flycast:latest .
```

The ARM variants can be built on x86_64 hardware and vice versa using `lscr.io/linuxserver/qemu-static`

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged lscr.io/linuxserver/qemu-static --reset
```

Once registered you can define the dockerfile to use with `-f Dockerfile.aarch64`.

To help with development, we generate this dependency graph.
