[SteamOS](https://www.steamdeck.com/) is an Arch based Linux distribution made by Valve Software. This container is a vanilla Arch install with Steam repositories added for software support. **This container will only work with modern AMD/Intel GPUs on a real Linux Host**

## Supported Architectures

We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker [here](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#manifest-list) and our announcement [here](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2019/02/21/the-lsio-pipeline-project/).

Simply pulling `lscr.io/linuxserver/steamos:latest` should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags.

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Available | Tag |
| :----: | :----: | ---- |
| x86-64 | ✅ | amd64-\<version tag\> |
| arm64 | ❌ | |
| armhf | ❌ | |

## Application Setup

*This container is currently in a Beta state and is developing quickly, things will change constantly and it may crash or not function perfectly especially when mixing Steam remote play frame capture with the web based [KasmVNC](https://kasmweb.com/kasmvnc) frame capture*

**SteamOS is designed for specific AMD based hardware, this container will only work properly on a host with a modern AMD GPU or Intel ARC/iGPU**

The following limitations currently exist:
* You must run the desktop mode initially to login to Steam, then you can switch to `STARTUP=BIGPICTURE`
* Sunshine is available in both desktop mode (KDE) and BIGPICTURE, but gamepads using Sunshine does not currently work. 
* In Desktop mode most proton games will kill off kwin_x11 and in turn disable keyboard and gamepad input. For remote play in Desktop mode it is mostly Valve or Linux native titles that function properly.
* If games are not launching and are Windows based ensure you have forced a compatibility layer in it's settings to use Proton Experimental or Proton 8.
* BIGPICTURE STARTUP mode connecting via Sunshine will have much better game compatibility and generally be less buggy. Titles are running how the Steam Deck expects them to inside a gamescope renderer, outside of the lack of gamepads this works identically to a Deck.
* Sunshine auto discovery is not functional, you will need to manually enter the IP in your client. 
* Remote play does not function well in BIGPICTURE mode, this mode is optimized for a single resolution passed on boot using Sunshine.

To improve compatibility we ingest drivers from vanilla Arch repos, *but NVIDIA will never work*. This is a limitation of the [KasmVNC](https://kasmweb.com/kasmvnc) virtual framebuffer that we use as it only has logic for the [DRI3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Rendering_Infrastructure) framework which is not available for NVIDIA. We recommend using a modern RDNA AMD card or Intel ARC card, but lower end GPUs might work for some games we do bundle all the drivers that are possible to install.
Compatibility should be on par with the Steam Deck, if it is certified for the Deck it will run in our testing and the game should be fully playable.

The application can be accessed at:

* http://yourhost:3000/
* https://yourhost:3001/

### Options in all KasmVNC based GUI containers

This container is based on [Docker Baseimage KasmVNC](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-baseimage-kasmvnc) which means there are additional environment variables and run configurations to enable or disable specific functionality.

#### Optional environment variables

| Variable | Description |
| :----: | --- |
| CUSTOM_PORT | Internal port the container listens on for http if it needs to be swapped from the default 3000. |
| CUSTOM_HTTPS_PORT | Internal port the container listens on for https if it needs to be swapped from the default 3001. |
| CUSTOM_USER | HTTP Basic auth username, abc is default. |
| PASSWORD | HTTP Basic auth password, abc is default. If unset there will be no auth |
| SUBFOLDER | Subfolder for the application if running a subfolder reverse proxy, need both slashes IE `/subfolder/` |
| TITLE | The page title displayed on the web browser, default "KasmVNC Client". |
| FM_HOME | This is the home directory (landing) for the file manager, default "/config". |
| DRINODE | If mounting in /dev/dri for [DRI3 GPU Acceleration](https://www.kasmweb.com/kasmvnc/docs/master/gpu_acceleration.html) allows you to specify the device to use IE `/dev/dri/renderD128` |

### Networking

**Windows users will need to disable their firewall for remote play to function in the default setup**

**The Steam Link application will only function in Host or Macvlan networking modes**

Steam network discovery in it's current state is pretty inflexible, to function locally it uses broadcast packets that cannot traverse subnets and this becomes a problem when using a Docker subnet. In the default configuration we recommend forwarding the ports and passing the underlying host's IP using the `HOST_IP` environment variable. When the container spins up it will set this IP as it's default route allowing remote play to function over a local network given the client does not have a firewall in the way blocking the traffic. If you never plan to use remote play or only plan on using it fully remote off your LAN through a Valve relay then you can essentially rip out all the logic for Steam port forwarding and passing the host ip to the container. 

Optimally [Macvlan](https://docs.docker.com/network/drivers/macvlan/) can be used to give this container a dedicated IP on your network and run closer to how a bridged VM would. This is the most compatible methodology and will avoid any potentially port conflicts. 

[Host Networking](https://docs.docker.com/network/drivers/host/) can also be used, but might run into a port conflict with what the container is trying to init and the underlying host.

### Gameplay

Keep in mind this container thinks it is a Steam Deck, games will be optimized for it's controller layout and video settings. To get a desktop Steam experience for remote play or testing there is a desktop shortcut provided `Steam Desktop Mode`.
Most games will tie themselves to the current desktop resolution as set when you connect to the web interface, a method for setting the resolution via the web interface is being worked on.
Authentication (not two factor) is not currently saved when closing and re-opening Steam for any reason when in Deck mode this is also being worked on. This means anytime you restart the container you will need to access the web interface and log back in.
It is possible to play games over KasmVNC, but it as a protocol is not currently optimized for gaming. You will experience more frame skipping and latency as compared to Steam remote play.

## Usage

To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli.

## Parameters

Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

### Ports (`-p`)

| `RESOLUTION=1920x1080` | When booting into BIGPICTURE mode the screen resolution will be bound to this value. |

### Volume Mappings (`-v`)

| Volume | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `/config` | Users home directory in the container, stores all files and games. |
| `/dev/input` | Optional for gamepad support. *Only working for Steam Remote Play |
| `/run/udev/data` | Optional for gamepad support. *Only working for Steam Remote Play |

### Device Mappings (`--device`)

| Parameter | Function |
| :-----:   | --- |
| `/dev/dri` | Video card passthrough to Steam. |

#### Miscellaneous Options

| Parameter | Function |
| :-----:   | --- |
| `--hostname=` | Specify the hostname of the host, this is useful for keeping a persistent hostname between upgrades and identifying the server in the remote play Steam Client. |
| `--shm-size=` | This is needed for the steam browser to function properly. |
| `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` | This is needed to allow kernel syscalls made by Steam. |
| `--security-opt apparmor=unconfined` | For Debian/Ubuntu hosts Steam needs elevated perms that AppArmor blocks. |

### Portainer notice

{% hint style="warning" %}
This image utilises `cap_add` or `sysctl` to work properly. This is not implemented properly in some versions of Portainer, thus this image may not work if deployed through Portainer.
{% endhint %}

## Environment variables from files (Docker secrets)

You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend `FILE__`.

As an example:

```bash
-e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword
```

Will set the environment variable `PASSWORD` based on the contents of the `/run/secrets/mysecretpassword` file.

## Umask for running applications

For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional `-e UMASK=022` setting.
Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) before asking for support.

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags), permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```bash
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```
