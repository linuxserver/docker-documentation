[Cops](http://blog.slucas.fr/en/oss/calibre-opds-php-server) by SÃ©bastien Lucas, stands for Calibre OPDS (and HTML) Php Server.

COPS links to your Calibre library database and allows downloading and emailing of books directly from a web browser and provides a OPDS feed to connect to your devices.

Changes in your Calibre library are reflected immediately in your COPS pages.

See : [COPS's home](http://blog.slucas.fr/en/oss/calibre-opds-php-server) for more details.

Don't forget to check the [Wiki](https://github.com/seblucas/cops/wiki).

## Why? (taken from the author's site)

In my opinion Calibre is a marvelous tool but is too big and has too much
dependencies to be used for its content server.

That's the main reason why I coded this OPDS server. I needed a simple
tool to be installed on a small server (Seagate Dockstar in my case).

I initially thought of Calibre2OPDS but as it generate static file no
search was possible.

Later I added an simple HTML catalog that should be usable on my Kobo.

So COPS's main advantages are :
 * No need for many dependencies.
 * No need for a lot of CPU or RAM.
 * Not much code.
 * Search is available.
 * With Dropbox / owncloud it's very easy to have an up to date OPDS server.
 * It was fun to code.

If you want to use the OPDS feed don't forget to specify feed.php at the end of your URL.


## Supported Architectures

Our images support multiple architectures such as `x86-64`, `arm64` and `armhf`. We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker [here](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#manifest-list) and our announcement [here](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2019/02/21/the-lsio-pipeline-project/). 

Simply pulling `linuxserver/cops` should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags.

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Tag |
| :----: | --- |
| x86-64 | amd64-latest |
| arm64 | arm64v8-latest |
| armhf | arm32v7-latest |


## Usage

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container from this image.

### docker

```
docker create \
  --name=cops \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=Europe/London \
  -p 80:80 \
  -v <path to data>:/config \
  -v <path to data>:/books \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  linuxserver/cops
```


### docker-compose

Compatible with docker-compose v2 schemas.

```yaml
---
version: "2"
services:
  cops:
    image: linuxserver/cops
    container_name: cops
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/London
    volumes:
      - <path to data>:/config
      - <path to data>:/books
    ports:
      - 80:80
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Parameters

Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

### Ports (`-p`)

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `80` | WebUI |


### Environment Variables (`-e`)

| Env | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `TZ=Europe/London` | Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London. |

### Volume Mappings (`-v`)

| Volume | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `/config` | COPS Application Data. |
| `/books` | Calibre metadata.db location. |



## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags), permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```

## Application Setup

Unlike other implementations of COPS in a docker container,  the linuxserver version gives you access to `config_local.php` in `/config` to customise your install to suit your needs, including details of your email account etc to enable emailing of books, it also includes the dependencies required to directly view epub books in your browser.



## Support Info

* Shell access whilst the container is running: 
  * `docker exec -it cops /bin/bash`
* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: 
  * `docker logs -f cops`
* Container version number 
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' cops`
* Image version number
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' linuxserver/cops`
