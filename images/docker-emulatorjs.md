[Emulatorjs](https://github.com/linuxserver/emulatorjs) - In browser web based emulation portable to nearly any device for many retro consoles. A mix of emulators is used between Libretro and EmulatorJS.

## Supported Architectures

Our images support multiple architectures such as `x86-64`, `arm64` and `armhf`. We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker [here](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#manifest-list) and our announcement [here](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2019/02/21/the-lsio-pipeline-project/).

Simply pulling `lscr.io/linuxserver/emulatorjs` should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags.

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Tag |
| :----: | --- |
| x86-64 | amd64-latest |
| arm64 | arm64v8-latest |
| armhf | arm32v7-latest |

## Application Setup

The Backend can be accessed at:

* http://yourhost:3000/

The first thing you will need to do is click to download the default art/configs from this interface, this will setup a skeleton directory in your `/data` mount. From there add roms to the respective `roms` directories and follow the on screen instructions to add them to your web frontend running on port 80.

The frontend application has been initially optimized around being used with a standard gamepad (more specifically for modern Xbox consoles that have chromium based Edge browsers). The navigation revolves around the up/down/left/right keys to browse the menus and launch games.
Mobile browsers will function, just keep in mind compatibility will be reduced especially for CD based games.

**It is important to note that some of the current emulators used for this frontend are obfuscated code, efforts are being made to [reverese engineer it](https://github.com/ethanaobrien/emulatorjs/) but you should know it can potentially reach out to third party services if you manually enable features like netplay (this should never happen in a stock setup). The point of this message is that on top of the de-obfuscation effort there is also effort to stop using binary blobs and shift to built from source libretro emscripten blobs, for now this web based emulation stack is the best for useability and compatibility. We are in the process to transitioning to libretro cores for emulators, currently 27/30 emulators have been replaced.**

**For Xbox users please click the select button a couple times after launching a game to ensure the B button does not trigger a "back" action in the browser. (official name "view button" it is the two small squares) Exiting the controller mode and back to browser controls can be triggered by holding the start button for 3 seconds. (official name "menu button" the three lines) You will be unable to use features like save states and modify controller layouts on the emulatorjs based emulators currently as I have not determined a methodology of re-entering controller mode once you exit it. All normal game saves will function given you exit the game play screen cleanly using the B button for back this includes multi disc games for psx. Your game saves are stored in browser storage by hostname so if you make any changes to your local hosted setup (port or IP) the saves will not follow with it. For libretro based emulators you can use the button combination start+select+L+R to access the libretro menu and change settings/save or load/etc.**

**We know about most of the oddities like crackling sound for some emulators, rendering issues, and games unreliably auto launching to fullscreen. In general full CD games on the Xbox web browser do not seem to work due to their size if you have a chd/pbp less than 450 megs it will run. Edge on Xbox has some kind of undocumented ram limitation of about a gigabyte. Until all emulators are transitioned to libretro cores the oddities of using self hosted EmulatorJS will not be something that can or should be solved using hacky workarounds interacting with obfuscated code. Just keep in mind these are full blown machine emulators running in Javascript in a browser, do not expect bare metal performance.**

## Usage

To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli.

### docker-compose (recommended, [click here for more info](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/docker-compose))

```yaml
---
version: "2.1"
services:
  emulatorjs:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/emulatorjs
    container_name: emulatorjs
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/London
      - SUBFOLDER=/ #optional
    volumes:
      - /path/to/data:/data
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
      - 80:80
      - 4001:4001 #optional
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### docker cli ([click here for more info](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/))

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=emulatorjs \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=Europe/London \
  -e SUBFOLDER=/ `#optional` \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 4001:4001 `#optional` \
  -v /path/to/data:/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  lscr.io/linuxserver/emulatorjs
```

## Parameters

Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

### Ports (`-p`)

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `3000` | Rom/artwork management interface, used to generate/manage config files and download artwork |
| `80` | Emulation frontend containing static web files used to browse and launch games |
| `4001` | IPFS peering port, if you want to participate in the P2P network to distribute frontend artwork please forward this to the Internet |

### Environment Variables (`-e`)

| Env | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `TZ=Europe/London` | Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London |
| `SUBFOLDER=/` | Specify a subfolder for reverse proxies IE '/FOLDER/' |

### Volume Mappings (`-v`)

| Volume | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `/data` | Path to store roms/artwork |

#### Miscellaneous Options

| Parameter | Function |
| :-----:   | --- |

## Environment variables from files (Docker secrets)

You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend `FILE__`.

As an example:

```bash
-e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword
```

Will set the environment variable `PASSWORD` based on the contents of the `/run/secrets/mysecretpassword` file.

## Umask for running applications

For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional `-e UMASK=022` setting.
Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) before asking for support.

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags), permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```bash
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```
