# Introduction

Welcome to the home of the LinuxServer.io documentation! It is our goal to ensure that all of our images are properly documented with all of the relevant information, in order to help our users get started. In addition to individual set up guides for each image, there is also general information, and best practices, pertaining to running Docker containers.

The team resides primarily in our Discord server. We also have a forum if chat isn't your thing.
