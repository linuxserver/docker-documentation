# Introduction

Welcome to the home of the LinuxServer.io documentation! It is our goal to ensure that all of our images are properly documented with all of the relevant information in order to help our users get started. As well as individual set up guides for each of our images, there is also general information pertaining to the running of Docker containers, and best practices.

The team resides primarily in our Discord server. We also have a forum if chat isn't your thing.
